# Ticket Management System Implementation

This use case demonstrates how the `HubSpot Tickets API`  can be utilized to streamline the customer support process by integrating the basic operations of ticket management such as create, read, update, and delete as single tickets and also as batches.

## Prerequisites

For each example, create a `Config.toml` file in the example root directory. Here's an example of how your Config.toml file should look:
```
clientId = "<clientId>"
clientSecret = "<clientSecret>"
refreshToken = "<refreshToken>"
```

## Running an example

Execute the following commands to build an example from the source:

* To build an example:

    ```bash
    bal build
    ```

* To run an example:

    ```bash
    bal run
    ```
